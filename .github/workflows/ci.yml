    - name: Clone Flutter SDK
      # We can't do a depth-1 clone, because we need the most recent tag
      # so that Flutter knows its version and sees the constraint in our
      # pubspec is satisfied.  It's uncommon for flutter/flutter to go
      # more than 100 commits between tags.  Fetch 1000 for good measure.
      # TODO(upstream): Around 2025-05, Flutter upstream stopped making
      #   tags within the main/master branch.  Get that fixed:
      #     https://github.com/zulip/zulip-flutter/issues/1710
      #   Pending that, fetch more than 1000 commits.
