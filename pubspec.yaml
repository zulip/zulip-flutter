# Keep the last two numbers equal; see docs/release.md.
version: 0.0.19+19

environment:
  # We use a development version of Flutter while in beta,
  # and the corresponding dev version of the Dart SDK.  The hope is
  # that by the time we want to release, these will have become stable.
  # TODO: Before general release, switch to stable Flutter and Dart versions,
  #   or pin exact versions: https://github.com/zulip/zulip-flutter/issues/15
  sdk: '>=3.6.0-149.3.beta <4.0.0'
  flutter: '>=3.25.0-1.0.pre.41'

# To update dependencies, see instructions in README.md.
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_localizations:
    sdk: flutter

  # For some packages that are pinned by the Flutter SDK, we write no
  # constraint, to avoid unnecessarily breaking when Flutter takes a
  # new version.  (This risks getting a new version that really is
  # incompatible; but that's true of Flutter itself on each upgrade.)
  # We only do this for packages with a history of major-version bumps
  # that caused more churn than real incompatibilities.
  intl: any  # pinned by flutter_localizations; churn history:

    # Google's emoji font. (Web uses these emoji for the "Google" emojiset.)
    #
    # This should not be used on iOS.
    # iOS doesn't support any of the formats this font is available in,
    # and if we use it on iOS (whether as a primary font or a fallback)
    # we'll get blank spaces where we could have had Apple-style emojis.
    #
    # Also, in text that might contain non-emoji glyphs, this should
    # always come after a non-emoji font in the chain of font-family
    # fallbacks. Letting this font handle e.g. space characters will
    # make text look weird.
    # TODO don't bundle this on iOS; it wastes several MB because it's unused.
