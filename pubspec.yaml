  # For some packages that are pinned by the Flutter SDK, we write no
  # constraint, to avoid unnecessarily breaking when Flutter takes a
  # new version.  (This risks getting a new version that really is
  # incompatible; but that's true of Flutter itself on each upgrade.)
  # We only do this for packages with a history of major-version bumps
  # that caused more churn than real incompatibilities.

    # iOS doesn't support any of the formats this font is available in,
    # and if we use it on iOS (whether as a primary font or a fallback)
    # we'll get blank spaces where we could have had Apple-style emojis.
    #
    # Also, in text that might contain non-emoji glyphs, this should
    # always come after a non-emoji font in the chain of font-family
    # fallbacks. Letting this font handle e.g. space characters will
    # make text look weird.
    # TODO don't bundle this on iOS; it wastes several MB because it's unused.
