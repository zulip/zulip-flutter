# The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to
# pub.dev using `flutter pub publish`. This is preferred for private packages.
publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

  # We use a development version of Flutter while in beta,
  # and the corresponding dev version of the Dart SDK.  The hope is
  # that by the time we want to release, these will have become stable.
  # TODO: Before general release, switch to stable Flutter and Dart versions,
  #   or pin exact versions: https://github.com/zulip/zulip-flutter/issues/15

# Dependencies specify other packages that your package needs in order to work.
# To automatically upgrade your package dependencies to the latest versions
# consider running `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions`. Alternatively,
# dependencies can be manually updated by changing the version numbers below to
# the latest version available on pub.dev. To see which dependencies have newer
# versions available, run `flutter pub outdated`.

    # This should not be used on iOS.
    # iOS doesn't support any of the formats this font is available in,
    # and if we use it on iOS (whether as a primary font or a fallback)
    # we'll get blank spaces where we could have had Apple-style emojis.
    #
    # Also, in text that might contain non-emoji glyphs, this should
    # always come after a non-emoji font in the chain of font-family
    # fallbacks. Letting this font handle e.g. space characters will
    # make text look weird.
    # TODO don't bundle this on iOS; it wastes several MB because it's unused.
