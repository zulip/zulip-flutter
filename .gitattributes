# Suppress noisy generated files in diffs.

# Dart files generated from the files next to them, or by Pigeon:
*.g.dart -diff

# Generated files for localizations.
lib/generated/l10n/*.dart -diff

# Data files for translations synced from Weblate:
assets/l10n/app_*.arb -diff
# though not the similar file that is the source for what to translate:
assets/l10n/app_en.arb diff

# Generated files for testing migrations:
test/model/schemas/*.dart -diff
test/model/schemas/*.json -diff

# Kotlin files generated by, e.g., Pigeon:
*.g.kt -diff

# On the other hand, keep diffs for pubspec.lock.  It contains
# information independent of any non-generated file in the tree.
# And thankfully it's much less verbose than, say, a yarn.lock.
#pubspec.lock -diff


# Treat SVG files as binary.  They're XML, but typically
# generated from a GUI editor and unenlightening to read.
