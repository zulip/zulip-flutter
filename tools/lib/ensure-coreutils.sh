# Usage:
#   . ensure-coreutils.sh
#
# Ensures GNU coreutils are available in PATH.
# May add to PATH, or exit with a message to stderr.
#
# The GNU coreutils are a basic piece of infrastructure for having
# a reasonable 21st-century shell scripting environment, so we
# freely invoke this in any of our scripts that need `readlink -f`
# or other features not always found without them.
#
# On any GNU/Linux system this is of course a non-issue.  Likewise
# on Windows: we inevitably require Git, and Git for Windows comes
# with a GNU environment called "Git BASH", based on MSYS2.
#
# So this is really all about macOS.  Fortunately it's easy to get
# coreutils installed there too... plus, many people already have
# it installed but just not in their PATH.  We write our scripts
# for a GNU environment, so we bring it into the PATH.

# Check, silently, for a working coreutils on the PATH.
check_coreutils() {
    # Check a couple of commands for GNU-style --help and --version,
    # which macOS's default BSD-based implementations don't understand.
    fmt --help >/dev/null 2>&1
    readlink --version 2>&1 | grep -q GNU
}
