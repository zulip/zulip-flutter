  ///   0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 3.2, 6.4, 10, 10, 10, ...
  ///
  /// To provide jitter, the actual wait duration is chosen randomly
  /// on the whole interval from zero up to the computed upper bound.
  ///
  /// This jitter strategy with a lower bound of zero is reported to be more
  /// effective than some widespread strategies that use narrower intervals.
  /// The purpose of jitter is to mitigate "bursts" where many clients make
  /// requests in a short period; the larger the range of randomness,
  /// the smoother the bursts.  Keeping the lower bound at zero
  /// maximizes the range while preserving a capped exponential shape on
  /// the expected value.  Greg discusses this in more detail at:
  ///   https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/pull/3841
  ///
  /// The duration is always positive; [Duration] works in microseconds, so
  /// we deviate from the idealized uniform distribution just by rounding
  /// the smallest durations up to one microsecond instead of down to zero.
  /// Because in the real world any delay takes nonzero time, this mainly
  /// affects tests that use fake time, and keeps their behavior more realistic.
