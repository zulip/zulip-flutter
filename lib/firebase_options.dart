  // included in published builds of client applications, and therefore
  // fundamentally public.  See docs:
  //   https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/api-keys
  //
  // This key was created fresh for this use in zulip-flutter.
  // It's easy to create additional keys associated with the same `appId`
  // and other details above, and to enable or disable individual keys.
  // See the Google Cloud console:
  //   https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials

  // TODO: Perhaps use a different key in published builds; still fundamentally
  //   public, but would avoid accidental reuse in dev or modified builds.
