<!-- This file is necessary for notifications to work in release builds.

     The issue is that the package:flutter_local_notifications API has us
     identify which icon we want to use via a string name, in Dart code,
     and that's invisible to the resource shrinker:
       https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#keep-resources
     If the icon isn't named in this file, it gets removed in release builds
     (more precisely, replaced with a 0-byte file, which is invalid for its
     image format).  The system then discards notifications that try to use
     the invalid icon file:
       https://github.com/zulip/zulip-flutter/issues/528
     -->
<resources xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
    tools:keep="@drawable/zulip_notification"
    />
