<!-- This file is necessary for notifications to work in release builds.

     The issue is that the Pigeon bindings for notifications API has us
     identify which icon we want to use via a string name, in Dart code,
     and that's invisible to the resource shrinker:
       https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#keep-resources
     If the icon isn't named in this file, it gets removed in release builds
     (more precisely, replaced with a 0-byte file, which is invalid for its
     image format).  The system then discards notifications that try to use
     the invalid icon file:

    tools:keep="@drawable/zulip_notification,@raw/chime2,@raw/chime3,@raw/chime4"
